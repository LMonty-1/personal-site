					Hey there! I&#39;m Luke Montgomery, but you&#39;ve probably heard me go by
					Monty. I&#39;m a computer science student at Westmont college and I&#39;m
					looking to be a software engineer coming out of college. I enjoy
					learning about esoteric programming languages and anything security
					related.
